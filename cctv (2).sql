As a result, the end user can see picture in total darkness at the distance of infrared emission produced by LEDs. A day and night camera can have infrared LEDs mounted on its housing or can accept the emission, produced by an infrared turret. Day and night cameras often have modifications in their digital signal processor (DSP) that compensates for the difference in illumination between day and night modes. HDR technology may also be used in more expensive models to compensate for the difference in illumination between shaded and lighted areas of surveillance.</p>\n<h3>Why Do I Need Day/Night Security Cameras?</h3>\n<p>A day/night security camera is a good addition to any security system because of its versatility.

According to the FBI, property crime was 85% of all crimes in the United States during 2019, with around 7 million reported and documented. In a constant trend, that number in years prior had been consistently falling and reduced further in 2020. While various factors contribute to such a trend, the implementation of security camera systems undoubtedly has had an effect on preventing criminal activity like property crime. According to a study by UNC, outdoor security camera reduce the chance of property crime by at least half. Furthermore, studies by Rutgers University and the Urban Institute have recorded surveillance reducing crime in areas they were installed. Such evidence proves that surveillance has an extensive effect by benefiting homes and businesses.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Pros_2_Monitor_Scenarios_and_Activities\">2: Monitor Scenarios and Activities</span></h3>\n<p>When away from the home or business, there might always be a worry that something might happen. Especially for parents, thoughts of your family&rsquo;s condition or how your kids are doing with the babysitter might be weighing heavy on your mind. Surveillance, especially indoor security camera , help to provide peace of mind when away from home by giving the mother or father the ability to make checkups as frequently as needed. Furthermore, when you own a larger plot of land or multiple pieces of property, securing the perimeter or general location becomes much easier. Furthermore, modern software allows for phone alerts when a camera detects something unusual based on specific parameters.</p>\n<p>Similarly, for business owners, the ability to regularly check up on daily business practices is a regular ability for those with security cameras. Such an ability allows managers and business owners to be offsite for whatever reason while regular staff can handle onsite work. Furthermore, managing parties can keep tabs on stock, customer interactions, and more even when away.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Pros_3_Gather_Evidence\">3: Gather Evidence</span></h3>\n<p>Having cameras installed in strategic places comes in handy when you need to monitor actions and words of people or during an event. modern security camera are not only equipped with high-quality video capabilities, but audio as well. The clear images coupled with flawless sound makes them more efficient than ever at recording a series of happenings.</p>\n<p>This is particularly helpful when dealing with a legal scenario, wherein the eye witness may have forgotten a certain important detail or may be providing with an accurate account of what really transpired. With a security camera, the legal authorities can see the series of events as they really unfolded.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Pros_4_Arrive_at_the_Right_Decisions\">4: Arrive at the Right Decisions</span></h3>\n<p>Footage from security cameras can help you make correct and fair decisions when settling disputes, both in domestic as well as professional scenarios. Whether it is dealing with a situation involving disagreements within your family, among your employees, or between a customer and your service staff, your doubts can be laid to rest with the help of your camera.</p>\n<p>Incorrect, inappropriate or fabricated claims made by customers or other authorities can be sorted out when you make your security camera your ally.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Pros_5_Maintain_Records\">5: Maintain Records</span></h3>\n<p>Security cameras are an excellent option when looking to keep a record of the goings-on in or around a business. Also applicable for homes, surveillance easily monitors how events transpire, how accidents or unintended events may go, and can be used as a reference for future consideration. Businesses can use cameras to monitor incoming traffic, especially with the help of access control and security turnstiles, while homeowners can maintain a record of whom visit their property. Furthermore, as mentioned above in Pros 2 and 3, negative interactions, unfortunate accidents, or criminal activity can be recorded for the benefit of a legal team.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Disadvantages_for_Security_Cameras\">Disadvantages for Security Cameras</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Cons_1_Privacy_Is_an_Issue\">1: Privacy Is an Issue</span></h3>\n<p>While security cameras can be watchful for threats, illegal behavior, or aggressive behavior, surveillance will also inevitably record everything in their vision. dome security cameras for example, are commonly placed in offices and warehouses. Schools, as another example, typically feature security cameras to monitor parking lots&nbsp;and keep the perimeter secure. However, such surveillance inevitably records everyone ingoing and outgoing through the school. Furthermore, facial recognition and licesnse plate recorgnization security camera (LPR) have an extensive capability to focus on specific qualities when within their view.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Cons_2_It_Can_be_a_Costly_Affair\">2: It Can be a Costly Affair</span></h3>\n<p>A traditional security camera system provides excellent support to the security of any home or business but can entirely be expensive. The implementation of security cameras typically requires running cables, as referenced in a past post, and includes extensive labor and multiple products to implement successfully. While that does not necessarily apply to smaller systems and wireless cameras, initial installation typically brings with it a heftier price tag. However, such an implementation also produces an excellent result in that a hardwired system typically lasts an owner for several years beyond the wireless options. Furthermore, the wires connecting the cameras to the recorder last for decades, being usable years after the cameras have been replaced multiple times.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Cons_3_They_Can_be_Vulnerable\">3: They Can be Vulnerable</span></h3>\n<p>At the end of the day, the average security camera is an electronic device. As we all know, too much of an impact or water in the wrong area can effectively disable a security camera. Outdoor security cameras feature an effective exterior to defend themselves against standard weather patterns, but if the wind carries debris that impacts the camera, strikes around it with lightning, or a nefarious person tampers with it, the camera could be disabled. While some products may be more effective than others, certain conditions or events will always be capable of neutralizing electronics in general.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Cons_4_Cant_Stop_Theft\">4: Can&rsquo;t Stop Theft</span></h3>\n<p>It is true, security cameras deter thieves, but they will not have much effect on those that are determined to commit a crime. A security camera system should thereby be viewed as both a part of a more significant security system meant to deter criminal activity and a form of deterrence by itself. However, they are indeed capable of helping to gather evidence around crimes that may occur under their watch. While they may not do much to outright thwart anything, they can capture everything that happens. Furthermore, security cameras can also provide alerts upon detecting events that occur, allowing you to contact the authorities when made aware of a crime committed against you.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '6508c2398b2c9_HD Surveillance Camera.jpg'),
(41, 'PTZ CAMERA', '<h2 id=\"what-are-ptz-and-eptz-cameras\">What are PTZ and ePTZ Cameras?</h2>\n<p>Pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras are built with mechanical parts that allow them to swivel left to right, tilt up and down, and zoom in and out of a scene. They&rsquo;re typically used to monitor wide open areas requiring a 180- or 360-degree view, and deployed in guard stations where active personnel can operate them through a remote camera controller. Depending on the camera or software, they can also be set to automatically follow motion-triggered activity or adhere to a pre-set schedule. PTZ cameras are generally implemented in tandem with a larger surveillance system, in which the PTZ tracks movement while a fixed camera takes detailed shots.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"ft\">Features and Advantages of PTZ Cameras:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Large Field of View:</strong>&nbsp;PTZ cameras are used to monitor a large area, and often recommended to use in conjunction with a fixed camera to avoid gaps in coverage. Depending on the model, cameras can move anywhere between zero pan/tilt and the full 360 degree pan/180 degree tilt. Some solutions also have digital pan and tilt, which allows for video to be adjusted after recording - though the resulting video would be grainer and lower res.</li>\n<li><strong>Motion-Based Auto Tracking:</strong>&nbsp;Auto tracking is a function that enables PTZ cameras to adjust their field of view to follow moving objects automatically. The use case for this function is typically best applied in quiet areas with minimal movement (for example, a museum after closing).</li>\n<li><strong>Time-Based Auto Scan:</strong>&nbsp;PTZ cameras can be configured with auto-pilot to scan pre-defined areas and move in patterns (tours). Preset positions can be programmed to change positions based on time. For example, a PTZ camera can be configured to pan, tilt, or zoom every 30 seconds to capture different areas of interest within the camera&rsquo;s overall surveillance area.</li>\n<li><strong>Remote Camera Control:</strong>&nbsp;Conventional PTZ cameras can be manually and remotely adjusted to track suspicious activity. This allows users to change the camera&rsquo;s field of view without having to go onsite. A few common control mechanisms include: Mobile apps, joystick controls, and computer apps which all allow operators to adjust cameras with the control they prefer.</li>\n<li><strong>Zoom Capabilities:</strong>&nbsp;Most PTZ cameras support optical zoom, which is used to view and capture faraway objects like license plates or faces. Optical zoom (ie: 20x, 30x, 40x) refers to the maximum focal length divided by the minimum focal length - the larger the number, the further the zoom.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"where\">Where PTZ cameras are commonly used:</h2>\n<p>PTZ cameras can be used in an ever wider range of areas like stadiums, large industrial yards, and other expansive outdoor areas. A few of the most suitable use cases are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stadiums: Help ensure crowd safety during concerts, events, or sports games. Capture the action and oversee seating areas, entrances and critical points.</li>\n<li>Parking lots: Scan wide areas with extensive coverage at key locations, including entrances, exits and high-traffic areas.</li>\n<li>Transportation hubs: Increase public safety by monitoring platforms, ticketing areas and waiting zones. Use facial recognition and investigate suspicious activities.</li>\n<li>Parks: Provide a safer environment for park-goers, deter vandalism and illegal behavior and monitor wildlife.</li>\n<li>Train yards: Monitor train yard operations, tracks and storage areas to safeguard assets, detect unauthorized access and respond to security breaches promptly.</li>\n<li>Storage lots: Gain a bird&rsquo;s eye view of sweeping areas from poles or towers. Monitor equipment, infrastructure and detect suspicious activities.</li>\n<li>Warehouses: Secure entry points, loading docks, storage areas and inventory in warehouses and distribution centers.</li>\n<li>Loading docks: Observe loading dock operations, prevent unauthorized access and deter theft or tampering of goods in transit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"article__title\">Disadvantages of PTZ Cameras</h2>\n<div class=\"article__body\">\n<p>It&rsquo;s helpful to understand the advantages and disadvantages of PTZ Cameras . Here is a list of PTZ camera cons or disadvantages.</p>\n<h3>Limited View</h3>\n<p>PTZ cameras have limited coverage, as they cannot record areas the camera isn&rsquo;t specifically looking at. They do not pan, tilt or zoom automatically to cover potential gaps in surveillance unless manually programmed with specific settings beforehand &ndash; leaving an opening for intruders who may slip by unnoticed.</p>\n<h3>Shorter Lifespan</h3>\n<p>PTZ cameras are more expensive and less durable than fixed solutions. They have a higher failure rate because they contain many moving parts for pan, tilt, and zoom functionality.</p>\n<h3>Surveillance Blindspots</h3>\n<p>Since PTZ camera movements are often preset, this can lead to blindspots if left unattended. Surveillance blindspots are almost unavoidable even when PTZ cameras are manned by security staff. It&rsquo;s challenging to have all fields of view (FOV) covered.</p>\n<h3>High Cost</h3>\n<p>Using a fisheye camera for surveillance can give you the coverage you require at the lowest possible cost.</p>\n<h3>Latency Sensitivity</h3>\n<p>Control or command latency could be a problem in PTZ cameras, especially if they are a long distance from their control center (increasing lag time).</p>\n<h3>High Risk of Malfunction</h3>\n<p>Mechanical or human install or control errors can lead to legal ramifications. It&rsquo;s essential to install PTZ cameras properly to ensure their proper function, especially in unpredictable weather conditions.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"types\">Types of PTZ Cameras:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>PTZ IP Camera:</strong> PTZ internet protocol (IP) cameras can be deployed via WiFi or Power over Ethernet (PoE). Compared to traditional analog PTZ cameras WiFi PTZ Camera: WiFi PTZ cameras connect wirelessly to a router without a hardwired connection. (However, they still require a power source.) A strong WiFi connection is also recommended to prevent issues with lag and video quality.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>PTZ PoE Camera:</strong>&nbsp;A PoE camera uses an Ethernet cable that plugs into a PoE switch to receive power and an internet connection. It generally has a connection distance much more powerful than WiFi.</li>\n<li><strong>PTZ Analog Camera:</strong>&nbsp;Analog (CCTV) PTZ cameras use an analog video signal to capture surveillance footage, and are wired to digital video recorders (DVRs) via coaxial cables. Analog PTZ security cameras typically cannot transmit video data on their own and require a DVR to support converting, compressing, and saving footage.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Outdoor PTZ Camera:</strong>&nbsp;PTZ cameras that are deployed outdoors must be able to withstand more extreme temperatures and weather conditions.

Compared to IP cameras, analog security cameras are usually capped to standard definition (SD) video quality and require a coaxial cable to transmit data in addition to a dedicated power cord. However, they tend to be reliable and have been the mainstay of video surveillance for decades.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3 class=\"heading1\">WHAT ARE ANALOG CAMERA IMPORTANT?</h3>\n<p class=\"para1\">Analog cameras have been the backbone of video surveillance systems for decades. For that reason, there are millions of analog cameras still operating today. This is why the Solink platform is designed to be compatible with both analog and digital security infrastructure.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h3 class=\"heading1\">ADVANTAGES OF ANALOG CAMERA:-</h3>\n<ul id=\"list1\">\n<li class=\"para1\"><strong>Cost&nbsp;</strong>- Analog cameras are less expensive than IP cameras. The price difference can lead to significant savings when multiple cameras are deployed. Savings are increased when existing wiring is in good shape and can be used for installation.</li>\n<li class=\"para1\"><strong>Easy-to-use&nbsp;</strong>- Analog cameras and their connected DVRs are easy to run and do not demand advanced technical skills.</li>\n<li class=\"para1\"><strong>Transmission distance&nbsp;</strong>- An analog surveillance system can transmit video up to 1.5 kilometers with twisted-pair cables and up to 300 meters when a coax cable is used.</li>\n<li class=\"para1\"><strong>Video quality</strong>&nbsp;- You can get an analog CCTV camera that supports HD resolution of up to eight megapixels for crisp and clear video quality.

A day and night camera has special lenses that allow infrared emission produced by infrared LEDs and reflected from objects to go through and reach a CCD or CMOS chip inside the camera. As a result, the end user can see picture in total darkness at the distance of infrared emission produced by LEDs. A day and night camera can have infrared LEDs mounted on its housing or can accept the emission, produced by an infrared turret. Day and night cameras often have modifications in their digital signal processor (DSP) that compensates for the difference in illumination between day and night modes. HDR technology may also be used in more expensive models to compensate for the difference in illumination between shaded and lighted areas of surveillance.</p>\n<h3>Why Do I Need Day/Night Security Cameras?</h3>\n<p>A day/night security camera is a good addition to any security system because of its versatility.

According to the FBI, property crime was 85% of all crimes in the United States during 2019, with around 7 million reported and documented. In a constant trend, that number in years prior had been consistently falling and reduced further in 2020. While various factors contribute to such a trend, the implementation of security camera systems undoubtedly has had an effect on preventing criminal activity like property crime. According to a study by UNC, outdoor security camera reduce the chance of property crime by at least half. Furthermore, studies by Rutgers University and the Urban Institute have recorded surveillance reducing crime in areas they were installed. Such evidence proves that surveillance has an extensive effect by benefiting homes and businesses.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Pros_2_Monitor_Scenarios_and_Activities\">2: Monitor Scenarios and Activities</span></h3>\n<p>When away from the home or business, there might always be a worry that something might happen. Especially for parents, thoughts of your family&rsquo;s condition or how your kids are doing with the babysitter might be weighing heavy on your mind. Surveillance, especially indoor security camera , help to provide peace of mind when away from home by giving the mother or father the ability to make checkups as frequently as needed. Furthermore, when you own a larger plot of land or multiple pieces of property, securing the perimeter or general location becomes much easier. Furthermore, modern software allows for phone alerts when a camera detects something unusual based on specific parameters.</p>\n<p>Similarly, for business owners, the ability to regularly check up on daily business practices is a regular ability for those with security cameras. Such an ability allows managers and business owners to be offsite for whatever reason while regular staff can handle onsite work. Furthermore, managing parties can keep tabs on stock, customer interactions, and more even when away.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Pros_3_Gather_Evidence\">3: Gather Evidence</span></h3>\n<p>Having cameras installed in strategic places comes in handy when you need to monitor actions and words of people or during an event. modern security camera are not only equipped with high-quality video capabilities, but audio as well. The clear images coupled with flawless sound makes them more efficient than ever at recording a series of happenings.</p>\n<p>This is particularly helpful when dealing with a legal scenario, wherein the eye witness may have forgotten a certain important detail or may be providing with an accurate account of what really transpired. With a security camera, the legal authorities can see the series of events as they really unfolded.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Pros_4_Arrive_at_the_Right_Decisions\">4: Arrive at the Right Decisions</span></h3>\n<p>Footage from security cameras can help you make correct and fair decisions when settling disputes, both in domestic as well as professional scenarios. Whether it is dealing with a situation involving disagreements within your family, among your employees, or between a customer and your service staff, your doubts can be laid to rest with the help of your camera.</p>\n<p>Incorrect, inappropriate or fabricated claims made by customers or other authorities can be sorted out when you make your security camera your ally.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Pros_5_Maintain_Records\">5: Maintain Records</span></h3>\n<p>Security cameras are an excellent option when looking to keep a record of the goings-on in or around a business. Also applicable for homes, surveillance easily monitors how events transpire, how accidents or unintended events may go, and can be used as a reference for future consideration. Businesses can use cameras to monitor incoming traffic, especially with the help of access control and security turnstiles, while homeowners can maintain a record of whom visit their property. Furthermore, as mentioned above in Pros 2 and 3, negative interactions, unfortunate accidents, or criminal activity can be recorded for the benefit of a legal team.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Disadvantages_for_Security_Cameras\">Disadvantages for Security Cameras</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Cons_1_Privacy_Is_an_Issue\">1: Privacy Is an Issue</span></h3>\n<p>While security cameras can be watchful for threats, illegal behavior, or aggressive behavior, surveillance will also inevitably record everything in their vision. dome security cameras for example, are commonly placed in offices and warehouses. Schools, as another example, typically feature security cameras to monitor parking lots&nbsp;and keep the perimeter secure. However, such surveillance inevitably records everyone ingoing and outgoing through the school. Furthermore, facial recognition and licesnse plate recorgnization security camera (LPR) have an extensive capability to focus on specific qualities when within their view.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Cons_2_It_Can_be_a_Costly_Affair\">2: It Can be a Costly Affair</span></h3>\n<p>A traditional security camera system provides excellent support to the security of any home or business but can entirely be expensive. The implementation of security cameras typically requires running cables, as referenced in a past post, and includes extensive labor and multiple products to implement successfully. While that does not necessarily apply to smaller systems and wireless cameras, initial installation typically brings with it a heftier price tag. However, such an implementation also produces an excellent result in that a hardwired system typically lasts an owner for several years beyond the wireless options. Furthermore, the wires connecting the cameras to the recorder last for decades, being usable years after the cameras have been replaced multiple times.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Cons_3_They_Can_be_Vulnerable\">3: They Can be Vulnerable</span></h3>\n<p>At the end of the day, the average security camera is an electronic device. As we all know, too much of an impact or water in the wrong area can effectively disable a security camera. Outdoor security cameras feature an effective exterior to defend themselves against standard weather patterns, but if the wind carries debris that impacts the camera, strikes around it with lightning, or a nefarious person tampers with it, the camera could be disabled. While some products may be more effective than others, certain conditions or events will always be capable of neutralizing electronics in general.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Cons_4_Cant_Stop_Theft\">4: Can&rsquo;t Stop Theft</span></h3>\n<p>It is true, security cameras deter thieves, but they will not have much effect on those that are determined to commit a crime. A security camera system should thereby be viewed as both a part of a more significant security system meant to deter criminal activity and a form of deterrence by itself. However, they are indeed capable of helping to gather evidence around crimes that may occur under their watch. While they may not do much to outright thwart anything, they can capture everything that happens. Furthermore, security cameras can also provide alerts upon detecting events that occur, allowing you to contact the authorities when made aware of a crime committed against you.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>', '6508c2398b2c9_HD Surveillance Camera.jpg', '[value-5]', '[value-6]', '[value-7]', 45, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),
(7, 'PTZ CAMERA', '<h2 id=\"what-are-ptz-and-eptz-cameras\">What are PTZ and ePTZ Cameras?</h2>\n<p>Pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras are built with mechanical parts that allow them to swivel left to right, tilt up and down, and zoom in and out of a scene. They&rsquo;re typically used to monitor wide open areas requiring a 180- or 360-degree view, and deployed in guard stations where active personnel can operate them through a remote camera controller. Depending on the camera or software, they can also be set to automatically follow motion-triggered activity or adhere to a pre-set schedule. PTZ cameras are generally implemented in tandem with a larger surveillance system, in which the PTZ tracks movement while a fixed camera takes detailed shots.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"ft\">Features and Advantages of PTZ Cameras:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Large Field of View:</strong>&nbsp;PTZ cameras are used to monitor a large area, and often recommended to use in conjunction with a fixed camera to avoid gaps in coverage. Depending on the model, cameras can move anywhere between zero pan/tilt and the full 360 degree pan/180 degree tilt. Some solutions also have digital pan and tilt, which allows for video to be adjusted after recording - though the resulting video would be grainer and lower res.</li>\n<li><strong>Motion-Based Auto Tracking:</strong>&nbsp;Auto tracking is a function that enables PTZ cameras to adjust their field of view to follow moving objects automatically. The use case for this function is typically best applied in quiet areas with minimal movement (for example, a museum after closing).</li>\n<li><strong>Time-Based Auto Scan:</strong>&nbsp;PTZ cameras can be configured with auto-pilot to scan pre-defined areas and move in patterns (tours). Preset positions can be programmed to change positions based on time. For example, a PTZ camera can be configured to pan, tilt, or zoom every 30 seconds to capture different areas of interest within the camera&rsquo;s overall surveillance area.</li>\n<li><strong>Remote Camera Control:</strong>&nbsp;Conventional PTZ cameras can be manually and remotely adjusted to track suspicious activity. This allows users to change the camera&rsquo;s field of view without having to go onsite. A few common control mechanisms include: Mobile apps, joystick controls, and computer apps which all allow operators to adjust cameras with the control they prefer.</li>\n<li><strong>Zoom Capabilities:</strong>&nbsp;Most PTZ cameras support optical zoom, which is used to view and capture faraway objects like license plates or faces. Optical zoom (ie: 20x, 30x, 40x) refers to the maximum focal length divided by the minimum focal length - the larger the number, the further the zoom.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"where\">Where PTZ cameras are commonly used:</h2>\n<p>PTZ cameras can be used in an ever wider range of areas like stadiums, large industrial yards, and other expansive outdoor areas. A few of the most suitable use cases are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stadiums: Help ensure crowd safety during concerts, events, or sports games. Capture the action and oversee seating areas, entrances and critical points.</li>\n<li>Parking lots: Scan wide areas with extensive coverage at key locations, including entrances, exits and high-traffic areas.</li>\n<li>Transportation hubs: Increase public safety by monitoring platforms, ticketing areas and waiting zones. Use facial recognition and investigate suspicious activities.</li>\n<li>Parks: Provide a safer environment for park-goers, deter vandalism and illegal behavior and monitor wildlife.</li>\n<li>Train yards: Monitor train yard operations, tracks and storage areas to safeguard assets, detect unauthorized access and respond to security breaches promptly.</li>\n<li>Storage lots: Gain a bird&rsquo;s eye view of sweeping areas from poles or towers. Monitor equipment, infrastructure and detect suspicious activities.</li>\n<li>Warehouses: Secure entry points, loading docks, storage areas and inventory in warehouses and distribution centers.</li>\n<li>Loading docks: Observe loading dock operations, prevent unauthorized access and deter theft or tampering of goods in transit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"article__title\">Disadvantages of PTZ Cameras</h2>\n<div class=\"article__body\">\n<p>It&rsquo;s helpful to understand the advantages and disadvantages of PTZ Cameras . Here is a list of PTZ camera cons or disadvantages.</p>\n<h3>Limited View</h3>\n<p>PTZ cameras have limited coverage, as they cannot record areas the camera isn&rsquo;t specifically looking at. They do not pan, tilt or zoom automatically to cover potential gaps in surveillance unless manually programmed with specific settings beforehand &ndash; leaving an opening for intruders who may slip by unnoticed.</p>\n<h3>Shorter Lifespan</h3>\n<p>PTZ cameras are more expensive and less durable than fixed solutions. They have a higher failure rate because they contain many moving parts for pan, tilt, and zoom functionality.</p>\n<h3>Surveillance Blindspots</h3>\n<p>Since PTZ camera movements are often preset, this can lead to blindspots if left unattended. Surveillance blindspots are almost unavoidable even when PTZ cameras are manned by security staff. It&rsquo;s challenging to have all fields of view (FOV) covered.</p>\n<h3>High Cost</h3>\n<p>Using a fisheye camera for surveillance can give you the coverage you require at the lowest possible cost.</p>\n<h3>Latency Sensitivity</h3>\n<p>Control or command latency could be a problem in PTZ cameras, especially if they are a long distance from their control center (increasing lag time).</p>\n<h3>High Risk of Malfunction</h3>\n<p>Mechanical or human install or control errors can lead to legal ramifications. It&rsquo;s essential to install PTZ cameras properly to ensure their proper function, especially in unpredictable weather conditions.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"types\">Types of PTZ Cameras:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>PTZ IP Camera:</strong> PTZ internet protocol (IP) cameras can be deployed via WiFi or Power over Ethernet (PoE). Compared to traditional analog PTZ cameras WiFi PTZ Camera: WiFi PTZ cameras connect wirelessly to a router without a hardwired connection. (However, they still require a power source.) A strong WiFi connection is also recommended to prevent issues with lag and video quality.\n<ul>\n<li><strong>PTZ PoE Camera:</strong>&nbsp;A PoE camera uses an Ethernet cable that plugs into a PoE switch to receive power and an internet connection. It generally has a connection distance much more powerful than WiFi.</li>\n<li><strong>PTZ Analog Camera:</strong>&nbsp;Analog (CCTV) PTZ cameras use an analog video signal to capture surveillance footage, and are wired to digital video recorders (DVRs) via coaxial cables. Analog PTZ security cameras typically cannot transmit video data on their own and require a DVR to support converting, compressing, and saving footage.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Outdoor PTZ Camera:</strong>&nbsp;PTZ cameras that are deployed outdoors must be able to withstand more extreme temperatures and weather conditions. They&rsquo;re typically encased in a weatherproof exterior with an IP rating that indicates adequate protection against natural elements.</li>\n<li><strong>Wireless PTZ Camera:</strong> In cases where the installer is unable to run video cables, wireless PTZ cameras are able to transmit video wirelessly. Typically this is done through WiFi, although transmitter sets can be used to convert analog signals. Wireless PTZ cameras are typically deployed for long-distance outdoor monitoring where it&rsquo;s difficult or expensive to run cabling.</li>\n</ul>', '650862713c6d1_ptz.jpg', '[value-5]', '[value-6]', '[value-7]', 45, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00');
